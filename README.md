# [DEPRECATED]
This repository has been deprecated in favor of https://github.com/proactivity-lab/go-moteconnection which provides all of the same functionality and adds direct serial port support. The API for creating a connection has however slightly changed.

# go-sfconnection
Serialforwarder connection library for go.
